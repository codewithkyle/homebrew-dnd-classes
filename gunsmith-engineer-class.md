# Gunsmith Engineer (5e Class)

*The alley ends in a high stone wall – a dead end! The bandits round the corner and advance on him, certain that he has no way to escape. The gunslinger flips a lever on his belt as the bandits near him. In a flash, he disappears. The thug's freeze, looking confused, unsure where their prey has gone. The sound of a firearm round being chambered behind them is the last thing that they hear.*

Though their motivations and tactics might be different, engineers employ their superior skills with machinery and technology to overcome the various obstacles that stand between them and their goals. Their resourcefulness allows them to invent and build devices that help them enhance their abilities and augment their weaknesses.

## Strange Technology

Not every scholar or inventor has the skills it takes to become an engineer. Engineers are not only students of science, but they are masters of turning scientific principles into new technology that has practical applications in the real world. Most have some education, though for many this education is the result of years of experimentation and tinkering rather than formal study. An engineer might be a member of a guild of like-minded craftspeople, or more likely, could simply be a self-taught loner with a talent for working with machinery. Engineers can do a little bit of everything, whatever the challenge they can invent, build, and adapt their gadgets to be the right tools for the job.

## Mechanical Affinity

Master of mechanical mayhem, engineers love to tinker with explosives, devices, and all manner of hazardous gadgets. They can take control of an area by placing turrets, supporting allies with alchemic weaponry, or lay waste to foes with a wide array of mines or bombs. Few engineers come from uncivilized lands, but that doesn't mean they are comfortable in social situations. In fact, many engineers find that mechanical devices make more sense than people. Clockworks and steam engines are infinitely more predictable than the average person could ever be. For this reason, engineers are sometimes seen as aloof or awkward.

# Creating an Engineer

When creating an engineer, think about how your character learned the skills needed to work with machines. Did they teach themselves? Or were they trained by a guild or society of engineers? Perhaps they come from a culture like that of dwarves and gnomes where such skills are common. Or perhaps they just figured it out for themselves through experimentation.

## Attachment Schemantics

You are skilled at building firearm attachments that perform various functions when attached to a firearm. Once a Schematic becomes Known (researched) it cannot become unknown.

| Level | Schematics Known  | Trivial | Simple | Advanced | Intricate |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | --------- |
| 1st   | 7                 |
| 2nd   | 8                 |
| 3rd   | 9                 |
| 4th   | 10                |
| 5th   | 11                |
| 6th   | 12                |
| 7th   | 13                |
| 8th   | 14                |
| 9th   | 15                |
| 10th  | 16                |
| 11th  | 17                |
| 12th  | 18                |
| 13th  | 19                |
| 14th  | 20                |
| 15th  | 22                |
| 16th  | 23                |
| 17th  | 23                |
| 18th  | 24                |
| 19th  | 25                |
| 20th  | 26                |

At 1st level, you gain access to a limited amount of attachments. You can choose what attachments you wish to research using the List of Attachments. The Schematics Known column above shows how many schematics you can create/research at each level along with the complexity of each schematic. Each attachment consumes a schematic.

### Creating Schematics

2 Energy can be expended to instantly complete the Research or Blueprinting step.

1. Research / brainstorming (4 hours)
    - **Trivial:** INT DC 10
    - **Simple:** INT DC 14
    - **Advacned:** INT DC 16
    - **Intricate:** INT DC 18
1. Blueprinting (8 hours)

A schematic becomes Known and consumes one of the Schematics Know slots after successfully researching (step 1). Schematics must be blueprinted before they can be crafted. Blueprinting a schematic consumes (1d4 paper and 2d12 ink). Blueprints can be lost or destroyed. If you fail the INT DC check you must restart the research timer.

### Creating Attachments

| Complexity Level | Cost (materials) | Time    |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| Trivial          | 25gp             | 2 hours |
| Simple           | 40gp             | 4 hours |
| Advanced         | 75gp             | 6 hours |
| Intricate        | 150gp            | 8 hours |

Attachments can be destroyed or lost. If an attachment is lost it must be remade. Attachments can only be created from blueprints.

### Equiping Attachments

It takes time and effort to equip an attachment. Attachments can be attached or removed from a firearm at the cost of 1 Energy per action.

### List of Attachments

#### Trival

#### Simple

#### Advanced

#### Intricate

## Energy

At the 2nd level, you gain 2 Energy, a personal expendable pool of points with an amount equal to your Engineer level. You regain 1d6 Energy during a short rest and fully regain it during a long rest. 1 Energy point is expended when modifying a firearm's attachment. Energy points can be expended when creating schematics to reduce the time.

## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach the 4th level and again at the 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level you can increase any ability score by 2 points or you can increase two ability scores by 1 point each. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 points.

## Academic Literacy

At the 6th level, you choose two intelligence-based skills. As an alternative, you could choose one intelligence-based skill and one set of tools you're not proficient in.

## Forging Expertise

Starting at the 5th level you are a master of the forge, capable of producing excellent work under budget and on time. When you forge an item yourself you can reduce the time requirement by one-half the default value. Your expertise has no effect if you pay a blacksmith to forge an item for you.

## Crafting Expertise

Starting at the 15th level you are a master crafter. You may add your proficiency bonus when performing the Researching DC check. When researching or blueprinting you can reduce the time requirement by one-half the default value.

## Junkyard Hero

Beginning at the 9th level you can use downtime to scavenge spare parts, useful chemicals, and raw materials which you can use to build your attachments. In order to do so, you must be in a city, junkyard, or another location where such items can be found. Your DM may limit the availability of certain types of materials depending on the location where you are scavenging. For each hour you spend scavenging you can locate 1d4 + your level's GP worth of materials. You can use the materials you collect while scavenging to pay the material cost when forging new attachments.

## Eureka!

Beginning at the 2nd level and again at the 7th, 13th, and 19th levels, you receive a flash of blinding brilliance. In this moment of you come up with an idea for a new weapon (list below).

- Shotgun
    - Pump-action
    - Semi-automatic
    - Break-action
- Assault Rifle
- Semi-Automatic Rifle
- Machine Guns
    - Submachine gun
    - Light machine gun
- Bolt-Action Rifle (sniper)
- Lever-Action Rifle
- Revolver
- Flamethrower
- Pipe Bomb
- Termite
- C4

## Indomitable

Beginning at the 13th level you can reroll a saving throw that you failed. If you do so you must use the new roll and you can't use this feature again until you've finished a long rest.

## Fast Hands

At the 5th level reloading, a firearm can be performed as a bonus action. At the 10th level packing a magazine, clip, or belt can be performed as a bonus action.

## Double Tap

At the 17th level, you may attack twice per turn.
